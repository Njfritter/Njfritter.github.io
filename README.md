# Personal Website Repo Using Github Pages

Thank you for visiting my website repo!

This repo will be dedicated to storing the code for my personal website.

I may make this private at some point, but since it will simply be displaying my projects this won't be likely. 

I will do my best to document what I have done here and any special things I have done.

## Intro

Hello, my name is Nathan Fritter and I have found my calling through everything data (analysis, transformation, extraction, etc.). 

I spent a few years in the Data Science club @ UCSB working on mini projects, helping other newer members with their skills and presented my findings to others.

I work on projects in my spare time, and am currently working on maximizing the impact my projects can have for others. As a result, I have since committed to better presentation and documentation of my projects so that my projects can be reproducible and easier to understand.

Included in this mission is presentation of projects along with high level explanations of what is going on in order to get the general gist of the methods used. 

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and may be in the form of an issue made, cloned repo + new branch + pull request, or any other method that seems appropriate. 

## Projects Featured

I will be featuring my prominent projects on my website, which includes:
+ Myers Briggs Natural Langauge Processing (NLP) Analysis
+ ML Mastery (Python "mini course" on data science)
+ Sentiment Analysis of Tweets by 2016 Presidential Candidates 
+ Data Mining Course (PSTAT 131) at UCSB on Student Alcohol Consumption

I will be adding more projects to this list as time goes, as well as detailed explanations and even accompanying blog posts!
